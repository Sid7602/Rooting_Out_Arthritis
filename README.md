# Rooting_Out_Arthritis
A medical purpose project which helps in Identifying Therapeutic Medicinal Plants for Rooting out Arhtritis.

This is a Deep Learning based project to Identify the image and classify into various therapeutic plants dataset which can be used to cure Arthritis.
The convolutional neural network used here is DarkNet53 and using Classification Learner tool we got top 5 Machine Learning Models best suited for identification and classification of the plants. The Models are:
1. Ensemble: Bagged Trees (Highest Accuracy)
2. Tree: Fine Tree
3. Tree: Medium Tree
4. Neural Network: Wide
5. Ensemble: Subspace Discriminant

The Complete_Dataset is a dataset of 200 medicinal plants from Vietnam. This is a Vietnam medicinal Plants Dataset.
Each category of plant from this dataset has 100 images with split of 60:40 ratio (60 train-dataset and 40 test-dataset), this makes upto a total of 20,000 images for the Vietnam Plants Dataset.

The New Dataset is created personally by comparing the species of plants available in Vietnam Medicinal Plants Dataset and the plants that are available in India for the cure of Arthritis Disease. For more information about the plants available in India for the cure of Arthritis Disease will be available in the following link:
